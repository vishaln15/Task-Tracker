# Task Tracker App

## Description

A simple task tracker application built with Angular. This app uses [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) for the mock backend. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Start backend server

```
$ npm run server
```

This occupies port 5000 by default. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. Refresh the browser should you change [db.json](./db.json) data manually.
